# THIS PROJECT IS AN ALTERNATIVE ONBOARDING PROJECT YOU CAN DO INSTEAD OF THE CHATBOT:


1. Make a custom webcrawler using any library (requests, scrappy, beutiful soup, ....)

2. Crawl the https://www.cco.purdue.edu/Calendar/ Calender, and print back to me in formatted way all the upcomming events on the site. 

This can be trickier than it looks. 

Go to Colab, and run this project there. Follow the same submission procedures given for everyone else.
