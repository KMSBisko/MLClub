# AI Student Advisor OnBoardingProject: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN ON LOCAL LAPTOP!!!

Instructions:

1. Load up colab: https://mcgrawect.princeton.edu/guides/Google-Colab-Introduction.pdf (Introduction to colab) 

2. Copy and paste the code in OnBoardProject.py into colab.

3. Turn on the GPU (DO NOT USE A PAID GPU) 

4. Trying running the code (It won't work)

5. Look in detail at each section of the code and see where you might need to apply changes. There are multiple solutions. 

6. Change the code so that the chatbot will run. 

Example of a conversation between me and the chatbot

You: hi
Hello! How can I assist you today?
----------
Tokens per second:309.06421999305684

Post Processing Time: 0.00035691261291503906

You: say a riddle
Certainly! Here's a riddle for you:

I am always coming but never arrive,
I have a head but never weep,
I have a bed but never sleep,
I have a mouth but never speak.

What am I?

(Think you know the answer? Take a moment, and then I'll give you a hint if you need it!)
----------
Tokens per second:84.96294468948744

Post Processing Time: 0.0003829002380371094

The postprocessing stuff and Tokens per second are just evaluating the preformance. You can remove the print statements 
or keep them for the metrics. 

As seen above, the model responds like chatGPT would to me. (You can add a "model:" label to every model response if you feel like it)

IMPORTANT:

Make sure to look at the comments, find where the code needs to be changed, do some research on your own, and change the code to allow the chatbot to run 
when you press the run button on colab (all the code should fit in a single cell, or you can split it up). 

This project is meant to gauge your ability to do research and come up with solutions to open ended problems.
Your chatbot could be a completly differant model then what I used in the skeleton code. As long as the end result is a working chatBot you have succeeded. 

I will be evaluating the end result and seeing what your end result/implementation looks like. DO NOT COLLABORATE WITH OTHERS. 


NOTE:
ChatGPT and AI is allowed. Feel free to use online AI tools to even the playing field if you lack experience. But do try to learn and play around with your code. 
See what a chatBot can do. 


FINAL:

ALL OF YOUR CODE MUST RUN ON COLAB WITHOUT CRASHING. As long as you do not ask for answers, you can ask me or other studens for conceptual understanding.
